# CS50X-Final_Project
This is a web application that allows you to converse with a bot that has an entrepreneurial mindset. I will be utilizing chatGPT from openai in the form of an API. In this webpage, the user will signup for this once in a lifetime opportunity to ask for unique business adivce from a creative bot. In order to start asking the bot some questions, they wiill first need to create an account with us, as well as enter their payment information through a stripe API. For simplicity's sake, it will cost $10 a month to use our platform. Once the user is logged in with their encrypted information, they will be able to ask for whatever burning business-related questions they may have, and will be able to receive that information whenever they would like. There will be 4 pages. 
- One displaying the homepage, with different tabs on the top for the other pages. 
- Another will display the settings of the application, allowing the user to log out, change their password, and other things. 
- Another will provide the user with the main area to ask for the advice.
- The final one will display a short history of the questions and answers previously asked/received. 

More information later!
